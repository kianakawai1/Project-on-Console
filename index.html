            The console is an operating system window where users interact with the operating system or with a text-based console application by entering text input through the computer keyboard, and by reading text output from the computer terminal.
            To open the console screen you must right click on a website, and then click inspect. Then go to the console section. In order to print anything on the console screen you must use the code "console.log();" and state your variable in the brackets.
